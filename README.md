# redux-state-management
We use redux to manage the states when the hierarchy becomes complex where we have to manage number of states, we know how to use useState hook to store our states but when our program gets complex and we have lots of states to manage then it's becomes very tough to make various states and handel them, so during such cases we use redux to manage our states, it's little bit complex to setup redux, but once it's setup our job of managing states becomes very easy.
Steps to follow whike creating rreduc store:
1)action creators(they're just functions who takes some arguments)
2)reducers
3)redux store
Once our setup is done we can call the dispatch method and pass the actions inside it.
